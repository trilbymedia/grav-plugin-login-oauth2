# Login OAuth2 Plugin

The **Login OAuth2** Plugin for [Grav CMS](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) allows user authentication against an OAuth2 Authentication Provider. This plugin makes use of [The League OAuth2 Client](http://oauth2-client.thephpleague.com/) 

Currently the core plugin supports the following providers:

* **Facebook** - https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/web
* **GitHub** - https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/
* **Google** - https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect
* **Instagram** - https://www.instagram.com/developer/authentication/
* **LinkedIn** - https://developer.linkedin.com/docs/oauth2

It's also possible to extend this plugin an create a new AOauth2 for specific providers. 

## Callback URL

When you setup your OAuth provider application, you will need to provide a Callback URL.  Grav passes this as part of the OAuth2 request process, but it needs to match the configuration on the server side.  Typically, when logging in via the the frontend **site**, the URL will look something like this:

```text
http://yoursite.com/task:callback.oauth2
```

Where `http://yoursite.com` is the URL of your Grav-based site.  If you are using SSL, then this URL will be:

```text
https://yoursite.com/task:callback.oauth2
```

If you use the OAuth2 plugin to login to the **admin** side of your Grav site, your callback URL will look like this:

```text
http://yoursite.com/admin/task:callback.oauth2
```

Where `http://yoursite.com/admin` is the URL you use to log into the admin plugin. Again, if you have this under SSL, you would need to use `https://` rather than `http://`.  Some OAuth2 providers allow you to use provide multiple callback URLs, and in this case you can use the same application setup with multiple URLs, to work with the **site** and the **admin** and potentially `http://` and `https://` URLs.  However, some providers only allow a single callback URL, and in these cases you need to create multiple OAuth2 applications to handle each callback URL.


## Installation

Installing the Login OAuth2 plugin can be done in one of two ways. The GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation method enables you to quickly and easily install the plugin with a simple terminal command, while the manual method enables you to do so via a zip file.

### GPM Installation (Preferred)

The simplest way to install this plugin is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) through your system's terminal (also called the command line).  From the root of your Grav install type:

    bin/gpm install login-oauth2

This will install the Login OAuth2 plugin into your `/user/plugins` directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins/login-oauth2`.

### Manual Installation

To install this plugin, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins`. Then, rename the folder to `login-oauth2`. You can find these files on [GitHub](https://github.com/trilbymedia/grav-plugin-login-oauth2) or via [GetGrav.org](http://getgrav.org/downloads/plugins#extras).

You should now have all the plugin files under

    /your/site/grav/user/plugins/login-oauth2
    
Before configuring this plugin, you should copy the `user/plugins/login-oauth2/login-oauth2.yaml` to `user/config/plugins/login-oauth2.yaml` and only edit that copy.    

### Admin Installation

If you use the admin plugin, you can install directly through the admin plugin by browsing the to `Plugins` in the sidebar menu and clicking on the `Add` button.

Configuring the Login OAuth2 plugin is as easy as navigating to the `Plugins` manager, and editing the configuration options.

> Note that if you use the admin plugin, a file with your configuration will be saved in the `user/config/plugins/login-oauth2.yaml`.

### Usage

Once properly configured, the functionality of the OAuth2 plugin is simple for the user.  The login form will display `enabled` OAuth2 Providers, and the user can click on one which will then redirect them to the provider to authenticate and `accept` the permissions requested via the `scope` fields.  Upon completion of this process, the user will then be redirected back to the site where they will now be logged in.

#### OAuth2 User Data

Any user data available via the `scope` provider options will be retrieved.  Core fields like `username`, and `email` will be stored on the Grav user object, and anything else that is provider-specific can be optionally stored as well.  By default, the Grav user object **is not** persisted to a physical Grav account YAML file, instead it's just kept in session temporarily.

#### Storing Grav User

By default the OAuth2 plugin does not store any local user information.  Upon successfully authenticating against the OAuth2 user, a user is created and is available during the session.  However, upon returning, the user must re-authenticate and the OAuth2 data is retrieved again.

If you want to be able to set user data (extra fields, or specific user access) for a particular user, you can enable the `save_grav_user` option, and this will create a local Grav user in the `accounts/` folder.  This is a local record of the user and attributes can be set here.  

> NOTE: Any attribute stored under the provider key (e.g. `github:`) in the user account file will be overwritten by the plugin during the next login.  This information is always in sync with latest data from the provider.  
>  
> Also note that the password will never be stored in the Grav user under `accounts/`.

#### OAuth2 to Grav Access Mapping

The OAuth2 plugin provides a flexible way to map your OAuth2 users into Grav.  

> For Groups and Access mapping to work properly a valid `search_dn`, `query_dn` and `group_query` is required.

The default configuration for `default_access_levels.access` looks like:

```yaml
user:
  site:
    login: true
```

In order for a front-end user to be able to log into a Grav site the minimum of `site: [login: true]` is required. You can of course configure this with any access settings you wish to provide. 

It is not advised to provide any `admin` access via OAuth2 accounts, but if you wish a particular OAuth user to be able to log into the admin, you should enable the `save_grav_user` option, so the userdata is persisted as a Grav Account YAML file, and then manually add the desired permissions.  These **will not** be reset to the default values on each login.

> NOTE: See the [Groups and Permissions Documentation](https://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/groups-and-permissions?target=_blank) for more information about how Grav permissions work in conjunction with access levels and groups.

### Admin Notes

New in version `2.0` is the support for OAuth2 providers to be able to login via the admin.  After careful consideration, we decided to provide configuration options for both `Site` and `Admin` as there are some providers that need to have a unique **OAuth2 Application** setup for each unique callback.  This is important because by default, Grav uses a different session for both `Site` and `Admin`.  Therefore you need a unique callback, one that goes to the frontend site, and one to the admin.  This means we have to provide a way to have unique application settings for both `Site` and `Admin`.  

There are some providers such as **Discord** and **GitLab** that actually allow for multiple callback URLs to be registered.  In this case, simply copy over the same `client_id` and `client_secret` for both `Site` and `Admin`.

Also, if you have the `system.session.split` option set to `false`, you are effectively sharing the session between `Site` and `Admin`, and again, you can share the `Site` configuration, but they need to be entered into both sets of options.

For admin logins to be useful, you need to ensure you set `store_grav_user: true` (which is not default behavior). This will ensure that when you login, a local accounts `.yaml` file will be create in `user/accounts/` folder.  A this point you can manually add the admin access required to log into the admin by directly editing the `.yaml` file that was auto-created during the login process:

```yaml
  access:
    admin:
      login: true
      super: true
    site:
      login: true
```

Of course adjust this `access.admin:` settings to whatever you need, but **NEVER** set this in the `default_access_levels:` setting for the plugin, or every user will have admin access.  You want to maintain control over who can access and who can't, especially those logging in with OAuth2 providers as there is no control over 'who' can sign in.

### Troubleshooting

To get a quick state of your OAuth2 configuration, you can simply dump out the Grav user on a temporary _secure_ page:

```markdown
---
title: OAuth2 Test
cache_enabled: false
process:
    twig: true
access:
    site.login: true
---

# Grav User

{{ vardump(grav.user) }}
```
